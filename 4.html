<div class ="first">
This is div #1MUJI, originally founded in Japan in 1980, offers a wide variety of good quality products 
including household goods, apparel and food. 
Mujirushi Ryohin, MUJI in Japanese, translates as “no-brand quality goods.”
MUJI is based on three core principles, which remain unchanged to this day:
1. Selection of materials
2. Streamlining of processes
3. Simplification of packages
MUJI's products, born from an extremely rational manufacturing process, 
are succinct, but they are not in the minimalist style. 
That is, they are like empty vessels. Simplicity and emptiness yield the ultimate universality, 
embracing the feelings and thoughts of all people.
